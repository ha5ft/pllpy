# RectPulsePAMGen class

```python
# This class generate samples of an PAM signal with rectangular pulse shape.
#   - The two logic level are 1.0 and -1.0.
#   - 5 different bit series could be generated. One of them is a random series.
#   - The bit length is controlled by a bit clock trigger signal and the
#     N parameter. A new bit value is generated for every Nth clock pulse.
# Algorithm:
#   Bit length control:
#       The clock pulse is a single sample long.
#       For every Nth clock pulse :
#           a new bit value is generated and a sample corresponding
#           to this new bit value is emitted
#       otherwise:
#           a sample corresponding to the last generated bit value
#           is emitted
#   Bit value generation:
#       5 different bit sequence could be generated.
#       The sequence being used is selected by the mode parameter, which is passed
#       to the constructor.
#       The constructor generates the starting bit value.
#       A new bit value is generated for every Nth clock pulse.
#       The bit sequences:
#           mode == 0 : random bit sequence generated by using random.random()
#                       numpy
#           mode == 1 : {-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,...} series
#           mode == 2 : {1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,...} series
#           mode == 3 : {-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,...} series
#           mode == 4 : {-1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,...} series
# Constructor:
#   pamgen=RectPulsePAMGen(self, mode, N)
#   Parameters passed to the constructor:
#       mode : selects the bit sequence
#       N    : determines the bit length in clock pulses
# next method
#   pamgen.next(clock)
#   Parameters:
#       clock : a single sample long clock pulse
#               for every Nth clock pulse a new bit value is generated
#   Returnt:
#       b : current sample of the NRZ signal
