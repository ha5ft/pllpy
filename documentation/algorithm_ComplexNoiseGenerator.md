# ComplexNoiseGenerator class

```python
# The ComplexNoiseGen class provides complex noise signal represented by the
# inphase and quadrature phase real signal pair.
# It uses the random generator from the nympy library.
# The noise
#   - Gaussian noise
#   - The inphase and quadrature phase noise is independent.
#   - The mean value of the inphase and quadrature phase noise is 0.0
#   - The variance of the inphase and quadrature phase noise is 0.5
#   - The variance of the complex noise is 1.0
#   - The samplig frequency is : fs
# Algorithm:
#   We use the noise generator generated by default.rng() from numpy.random to
#   generate noise sample. We use one noise geberator for generating the inphase
#   samples and another one for generating the quadrature phase samples. This
#   way the inphase and quadrature phase noise will be independent.
# Constructor:
#   noise=ComplexNoiseGen()
#   Parameter passed to the constructor:
#       None
# next method
#   noise.next()
#   Parameters:
#       None
#   Return:
#       Iy[n]       : output inphase noise sample
#       Qy[n]       : output quadrature phase noise sample
